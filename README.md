# Text Adventure Game in React

## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through creating a text adventure game in React. The game displays a series of text nodes, each presenting a scenario, and offers choices to the player that lead to different outcomes.

## Setup

Create a new React app: `npx create-react-app text-adventure-game`

Structure your project with components: Game, StartPopup, GameContent.

## Game Component

The Game component is the entry point of your game. It manages whether the start popup or the game content should be displayed.
It also includes a function to restart the game, passed down to GameContent.

## StartPopup Component

This component displays the initial game instructions and a start button.
On clicking the start button, the game content is displayed.

## GameContent Component

It manages the display of the game's text and options based on the current node.
Options lead to different nodes based on the player's choices.

## Managing State

Use React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the game's state and side effects, like updating the current node.
A global state management solution (like Context API or Redux) might be beneficial for more complex state logic.

## Handling Background Images

Show how to dynamically change the background image based on the current node using inline styles or CSS classes.

## Conclusion

This game is a basic framework. You can expand it by adding more nodes, enhancing the story, and introducing more complex game mechanics like inventory management.

## Deploying

Deploy your game using platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages to share it with others.
By following this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of React development while creating an engaging text adventure game. Enjoy coding and let your imagination guide the adventure!
